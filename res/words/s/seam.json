Seam简介 Seam全称是Jboss Seam, 是一系列 Java EE 的可移植扩展和工具集合。它通过整合一系列的某一特定领域的功能模块，使开发者能够创建丰富的标准互联网应用。这种模块化设计还允许用户基于其项目需求的选择使用相应的模块，而不必全部采用一个大型的整体框架 。 它通过把JSF与EJB3.0组件合并在一起，以及利用JDK5.0的Annotation技术，从而为开发基于Web的企业应用程序提供一个最新的模式。Seam可以让你把EJB组件直接绑定到JS"},"collins":[{"entry":[{"posp":"N-COUNT","tran":"(两块布的)缝，线缝,接缝","def":"A seam is a line of stitches which
