If both were the same, the umpire took the forfeit money; if not it went to the person who accepted the valuation. The term handicap race was applied (late 18th cent.) to a horse race in which an umpire decided the weight to be carried by each horse, the owners showing acceptance or dissent in a similar way: hence in the late 19th cent. handicap came to mean the extra weight given to the superior horse"}],"encyclopedia":{"image":"","url":"http://baike.baidu.com/view/8279810.htm","content":" Handicap 在高尔夫运动中称为“差点”，是苏格兰人发明的。 什么是差点 差点是一个高尔夫球员锛埐还苁侵耙登蛟被蚴且涤喟谜唢級通过在一家球场或几家球场打球后被给与的一个评比数字。差点有两个组成因素，一个是球场难度，另一个是打球者在该球场的成绩。球场难度由专业人员为球场做出评估后设定。球场的天然条件，如果岭难度、水障碍、沙坑难度、树林分布及大风等，都包括在球场难度值内。打球的成绩则是该球员在该球场取得的"},"collins":[{"entry":[{"posp":"N-COUNT","tran":"（生理或智力上的）残障，残疾","def":"A handicap is a physical or mental disability.","example":[{"ex":"He lost his leg when he was ten, but learnt to overcome his handicap.","tran":"他10岁时失去了一条腿，但他学会了克服自己的残疾。","tts_mp3":"http://res-tts.iciba.com/tts_dj/9/8/8/988eb8462e4d84309f76350a115f82a1.mp3","tts_size":"21K"}]},{"posp":"N-COUNT","tran":"不利条件;障碍","def":"A handicap is an event or situation that places you at a disadvantage and makes it harder for you to do something.","example":[{"ex":"She was away from school for 15 weeks, a handicap she could have done without...","tran":"她有15周没上学，这给她带来了本不该有的障碍。","tts_mp3":"http://res-tts.iciba.com/tts_dj/2/4/9/249ee116a83758cc73b9d1d1373c228d.mp3","tts_size":"23K"},{"ex":"Being a foreigner was not a handicap.","tran":"身为外国人并不是一个障碍。","tts_mp3":"http://res-tts.iciba.com/tts_dj/0/d/f/0dfdbc711f6a648ea3be007a468a56da.mp3","tts_size":"10K"}]},{"posp":"VERB","tran":"妨碍;使不利","def":"If an event or a situation handicaps someone or something, it places them at a disadvantage.","example":[{"ex":"Greater levels of stress may seriously handicap some students...","tran":"压力的加重可能会给一些学生带来严重的负面影响。","tts_mp3":"http://res-tts.iciba.com/tts_dj/4/7/e/47ecdab1317bdc349c89351bd81e35fb.mp3","tts_size":"19K"},{"ex":"The industrial injuries scheme takes into account the actual disability and whether it handicaps a person in working.","tran":"工伤赔偿方案要考虑实际残疾情况以及残疾是否会影响其工作能力。","tts_mp3":"http://res-tts.iciba.com/tts_dj/d/d/d/dddd9cb998d9ea171af686fa76c2225e.mp3","tts_size":"32K"}]},{"posp":"N-COUNT","tran":"（高尔夫运动中的）给弱者增加的杆数，差点","def":"In golf, a handicap is an advantage given to someone who is not a good player, in order to make the players more equal.
