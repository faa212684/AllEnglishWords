定义 Relay（中继，Relay Node）是指基站或用户不直接将信号发送给彼此，而是通过中继节点，经过信号放大或再生处理进行转发。 以简单的两跳中继系统为例，就是将一条基站-移动台链路分割为基站-中继节点和中继节点-移动台两条链路，从而能够将一条质量较差的链路替换为两条质量较好的链路，以获得更高的链路容量和更好的覆盖。特点 1、提高小区边缘用户吞吐率； 2、提供群移动服务； 3、临时网络部署； 4、扩大网络覆盖分类 1、"},"collins":[{"entry":[{"posp":"N-COUNT","tran":"接力比赛(如赛跑或游泳)","def":"A relay or a relay race is a race between two or more teams, for example teams of runners or swimmers.
